## 📌 Project Overview

**PlantHub – Virtual Plantation Recorder** is a web-based application designed to digitally record, track, and analyze plantation activities and tree growth over time. The project aims to promote sustainable environmental practices by providing an organized platform to monitor plantations and visualize growth trends using data-driven insights.

The system allows users to log plantation details such as tree species, planting date, and growth-related parameters. These records are stored and managed using a Django backend, while the frontend offers an intuitive interface for interaction. Additionally, the project integrates a machine learning model that analyzes historical growth data to assist in understanding and predicting tree growth patterns.

PlantHub bridges the gap between traditional plantation record-keeping and modern technology by combining **web development**, **data analysis**, and **machine learning** into a single platform. It can be useful for students, researchers, environmental organizations, and individuals interested in tracking and managing plantation data efficiently.
